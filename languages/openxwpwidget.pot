"The plugin can add custom keys/values into the ad-request. This will allow "
"you to add some special targeting rules to your banners so they might match "
"to the current posts much better. Please list the custom keys here (comma "
"separated) which the plugin should observe.<br /><br />Example:<br />A "
"standard openx parameter is named <b>source</b> - so when you type 'source' "
"here and your posts contain a custom key 'source', the plugin will append "
"all values of the custom key 'source' to the ad-request (multiple values are "
"joined by '_', which allow you to specify targeting rules 'contains'. Lets "
"assume your post contains the following values for source: 'motorbike', "
"'car' and 'driving'. As a result the plugin will add "
"'source=_motorbike_car_driving_' to the ad-request. A banner with the "
"targeting rule: 'Site:source' contains '_motorbike_' will match the rule and "
"can be displayed.<br /><br />Please read further information about openx "
"targeting rules <a href='%s' target='_blank'>here</a>."
