This is a plugin/widget for the WordPress publishing platform. It will let
you serve banners at your WordPress webpages with ease. This document
describe how to get started.

Installation
------------

1) Copy the file openx-wp-widget.php into the /wp-content/plugins or
   add this plugin to your wordpress from the repository.

2) Login into your WordPress administration account and activate the
   plugin "openxwpwidget" at the plugin management page. This will add
   a new menu item OpenX-WP to the administration pages, below settings.

3) Change to the OpenX-WP setup page and type the url to the OpenX adserver
   you like to use into the textfield. You have to include the path to
   to the delivery folder, i.e. adserver.example.com/www/delivery

4) You are now ready to add banner-tags to your content. If you havn't 
   already, create a zone at your OpenX-adserver and write down the
   zoneID. A banner-tag look like {openx:NNN}, NNN is your zoneID, i.e.
   use {openx:17} for zoneID 17. You can add banner-tags anywhere into
   your content, except the sidebar(s). See 5) how to add banners to
   the sidebar.

5) To add banners to a sidebar, first you have to add the OpenX-WP-Widget
   too the sidebar. This can be done at the Design / Widget pages in your
   WordPress administration. You'll find there a list of already installed
   widgets. Click at "Add" of OpenX Widget to serve banners from within
   the sidebar. OpenX-Widget appears below "Current Widgets".

6) Click at "Edit" of OpenX Widget.

7) Select how many rows of bannes you like to serve in your sidebar. If
   your OpenX-Zone serve skyscrapers, usually you choose just 1. For each
   row of banners you type the zoneID into the zoneID textfield.

8) Don't forget to "Save Changes".

9) done.
